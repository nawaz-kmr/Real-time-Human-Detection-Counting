# Real-time-Human-Detection-Counting.

In this Project, I  am going to build the Human Detection and Counting System through Webcam [or video or images].

Project Prerequisites
1. OpenCV: A strong library used for machine learning
2. Imutils: To Image Processing
3. Numpy: Used for Scientific Computing. Image is stored in a numpy array.
4. Argparse: Used to give input in command line.

To run the project, please run below-mentioned commands as per requirements

1. To give video file as input:
   python main.py -v ‘Path_to_video’
    
2. To give image file as input:
   python main.py -i ‘Path_to-image’
   
3. To use the camera:
   python main.py -c True
   
4. To save the output:
   Python main.py -c True -o ‘file_name’
